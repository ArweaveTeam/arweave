# Arweave Server

This is the repository for the official Erlang implementation of the Arweave
protocol and a gateway implementation.

Arweave is a distributed, cryptographically verified permanent archive built
on a cryptocurrency that aims to, for the first time, provide feasible data
permanence. By leveraging our novel Blockweave datastructure, data is stored
in a decentralised, peer-to-peer manner where miners are incentivised to
store rare data.

# Getting Started

Download and extract the latest archive for your platform on the release
page, then run the included `bin/start` script to get started.

For more information, refer to the [mining guide](https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide).

# Building from source

## Requirements

The full arweave node functionality is only supported on Linux, but it is possible to run a
VDF Server on MacOS. Refer to the [mining VDF guide](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/mining/vdf)
for more information on running your own VDF server.

**General requirements:**
- OpenSSL 1.1.1+
- OpenSSL development headers
- GCC or Clang (GCC 8+ recommended)
- Erlang OTP v24, with OpenSSL support
- GNU Make
- CMake (CMake version > 3.10.0)
- SQLite3 header
- GNU MP

<details>
  <summary>To install the dependencies on <b>Ubuntu 22 (recommended)</b>:</summary>
  </br>

  ```sh
  sudo apt install erlang libssl-dev libgmp-dev libsqlite3-dev make cmake gcc g++
  ```

  On some systems you might need to install `libncurses-dev`.
</details>
</br>
<details>
  <summary>To install the dependencies on <b>MacOS</b>:</summary>  
  </br>

  1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  2. Install dependencies
  ```sh
  brew install gmp openssl@1.1 erlang cmake pkg-config
  ```

  **Notes:** 
  1. This process has only been tested on a fresh install of MacOS Ventura running on a Mac Mini M2. It may or may not work on other configurations.
  2. We have not validated mining or packing on MacOS, but as of May, 2024 the M2 provides the fastest known VDF implementation and so makes a good candidate for [VDF Servers](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/mining/vdf).

**Download the repo:**

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git
$ cd arweave
```

Increase the [open file
limits](https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide#preparation-file-descriptors-limit).

**Run in the development mode:**

```sh
./arweave-server \
peer ams-1.eu-central-1.arweave.net \
peer fra-1.eu-central-2.arweave.net \
peer sgp-1.ap-central-2.arweave.net \
peer blr-1.ap-central-1.arweave.net \
peer sfo-1.na-west-1.arweave.net
```

**Make a production build:**

```sh
$ ./rebar3 as prod tar
```

You will then find the gzipped tarball at `_build/prod/rel/arweave/arweave-x.y.z.tar.gz`.

### Testnet

To make a testnet build, run:

```sh
$ ./rebar3 as testnet tar
```

The tarball is created at `_build/testnet/rel/arweave/arweave-x.y.z.tar.gz`.

You can join the public testnet now:

```
./bin/start peer testnet-1.arweave.net peer testnet-2.arweave.net peer testnet-3.arweave.net
```

We recommend you do not use your mainnet mining address on testnet. Also, do not join the
testnet from the mainnet machine.

### Starting New Weave

To start a new weave, create a new data directory

```sh
mkdir -p localnet_data_dir
```
,
create a wallet:

```sh
./bin/create-wallet localnet_data_dir
```
,
and run:

```sh
$ ./bin/start-localnet init data_dir <your-data-dir> mining_addr <your-mining-addr>
storage_module 0,<your-mining-addr> mine
```

The given address (if none is specified, one will be generated for you) will be assigned
`1_000_000_000_000` AR in the new weave.

The network name will be `arweave.localnet`. You can not start the same node again with the
init option unless you clean the data directory - you need to either restart with the
`start_from_block_index` option or specify a peer from the same Arweave network via
`peer <peer>`. Note that the state is only persisted every 50 blocks so if you
restart the node without peers via `start_from_block_index` before reaching the height 50,
it will go back to the genesis block.

As with mainnet peers, each peer must be run in its own physical or virtual environment (e.g. on its own machine or in its own container or virtual machine). If you try to run two nodes within the same environment you will get an error like `Protocol 'inet_tcp': the name arweave@127.0.0.1 seems to be in use by another Erlang node`

When POST'ing transactions to your localnet make sure to include the `X-Network: arweave.localnet` header. If the header is omitted, the mainnet network will be assumed and the request will fail.

#### Configuring localnet

See the `localnet` section in [rebar.config](rebar.config) for instructions on changing
network constants for your localnet.

# Contributing

Make sure to have the build requirements installed.

Clone the repo and initialize the Git submodules:

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git
```

## Running the tests

```sh
$ bin/test
```

## Running a shell

```sh
$ bin/shell
```

`bin/test` and `bin/shell` launch two connected Erlang VMs in distributed mode. The master VM runs an HTTP server on the port 1984. The slave VM uses the port 1983. The data folders are `data_test_master` and `data_test_slave` respectively. The tests that do not depend on two VMs are run against the master VM.

Run a specific test (the shell offers autocompletion):

```sh
(master@127.0.0.1)1> eunit:test(ar_fork_recovery_tests:height_plus_one_fork_recovery_test_()).
```

If it fails, the nodes keep running so you can inspect them through Erlang shell or HTTP API.
The logs from both nodes are collected in `logs/`. They are rotated so you probably want to
consult the latest modified `master@127.0.0.1.*` and `slave@127.0.0.1.*` files first - `ls -lat
logs/`.

# Arweave Bug Bounty Program

Arweave core team has initiated an Arweave bug bounty program, with a maximum bounty of up to USD `1,000,000`. The program is focused on discovering potential technical vulnerabilities and strengthening Arweave core protocol security.

The Arweave core team puts security as its top priority and has dedicated resources to ensure high incentives to attract the community at large to evaluate and safeguard the ecosystem. Whilst building Arweave, the team has engaged with industry-leading cybersecurity audit firms specializing in Blockchain Security to help secure the codebase of Arweave protocol.

We encourage developers, whitehat hackers to participate, evaluate the code base and hunt for bugs, especially on issues that could potentially put usersâ€™ funds or data at risk. In exchange for a responsibly disclosed bug, the bug bounty program will reward up to USD `1,000,000` (paid in `$AR` tokens) based on the vulnerability severity level, at the discretion of the Arweave team. Please email us at team@arweave.org to get in touch.
