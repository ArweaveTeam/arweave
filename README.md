# Arweave Server

This is the repository for the official Erlang implementation of the Arweave
protocol and a gateway implementation.

Arweave is a distributed, cryptographically verified permanent archive built
on a cryptocurrency that aims to, for the first time, provide feasible data
permanence. By leveraging our novel Blockweave datastructure, data is stored
in a decentralised, peer-to-peer manner where miners are incentivised to
store rare data.

# Getting Started

Download and extract the latest archive for your platform on the release
page, then run the included `bin/start` script to get started.

For more information, refer to the [mining guide](https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide).

# Building from source

## Requirements

- OpenSSL 1.1.1+
- OpenSSL development headers
- GCC or Clang (GCC 8 recommended)
- Erlang OTP v24, with OpenSSL support
- GNU Make
- CMake (CMake version > 3.10.0)
- SQLite3 headers (libsqlite3-dev on Ubuntu)
- GNU MP (libgmp-dev on Ubuntu)

To install the dependencies on Ubuntu 22 (recommended), run:

```sh
sudo apt install erlang-base erlang libssl-dev libgmp-dev libsqlite3-dev make cmake gcc g++
```

Download the repo:

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git
$ cd arweave
```

Increase the [open file
limits](https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide#preparation-file-descriptors-limit).

## Join the 2.6 testnet

Follow the instructions from the previous section, then check out the branch:

```
git checkout testnet/2.6
```

Create an empty `wallets` folder in your data directory and put your wallet JSON there.

Run in the development mode:

```sh
./arweave-server data_dir [your_data_dir] peer testnet-1.arweave.net peer testnet-3.arweave.net
peer testnet-5.arweave.net storage_module 53,1099511627776,[your_wallet_addr] mining_addr [your_wallet_addr] mine debug
```

The node will create a `storage_module_1099511627776_53_[your_wallet_addr]` folder in the
data directory and attempt to sync and pack using the specified address the 54th TiB of the weave there. The testnet was forked off the mainnet so it may also download the chunks from the mainnet peers.

# Contributing

Make sure to have the build requirements installed.

Clone the repo and initialize the Git submodules:

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git
```

## Running the tests

```sh
$ bin/test
```

## Running a shell

```sh
$ bin/shell
```

`bin/test` and `bin/shell` launch two connected Erlang VMs in distributed mode. The master VM runs an HTTP server on the port 1984. The slave VM uses the port 1983. The data folders are `data_test_master` and `data_test_slave` respectively. The tests that do not depend on two VMs are run against the master VM.

Run a specific test (the shell offers autocompletion):

```sh
(master@127.0.0.1)1> eunit:test(ar_fork_recovery_tests:height_plus_one_fork_recovery_test_()).
```

If it fails, the nodes keep running so you can inspect them through Erlang shell or HTTP API.
The logs from both nodes are collected in `logs/`. They are rotated so you probably want to
consult the latest modified `master@127.0.0.1.*` and `slave@127.0.0.1.*` files first - `ls -lat
logs/`.

# Arweave Bug Bounty Program

Arweave core team has initiated an Arweave bug bounty program, with a maximum bounty of up to USD `1,000,000`. The program is focused on discovering potential technical vulnerabilities and strengthening Arweave core protocol security.

The Arweave core team puts security as its top priority and has dedicated resources to ensure high incentives to attract the community at large to evaluate and safeguard the ecosystem. Whilst building Arweave, the team has engaged with industry-leading cybersecurity audit firms specializing in Blockchain Security to help secure the codebase of Arweave protocol.

We encourage developers, whitehat hackers to participate, evaluate the code base and hunt for bugs, especially on issues that could potentially put usersâ€™ funds or data at risk. In exchange for a responsibly disclosed bug, the bug bounty program will reward up to USD `1,000,000` (paid in `$AR` tokens) based on the vulnerability severity level, at the discretion of the Arweave team. Please email us at team@arweave.org to get in touch.
