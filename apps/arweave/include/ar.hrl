	%% a part of the signature preimage) and transactions signed the way they were signed
	%% before the upgrade. The motivation is to keep supporting legacy client libraries after
	%% redenominations and at the same time protect users from an attack where
	%% a post-redenomination transaction is included in a pre-redenomination block. The attack
	%% is prevented by forbidding inclusion of transactions with denomination=0 in the 100
