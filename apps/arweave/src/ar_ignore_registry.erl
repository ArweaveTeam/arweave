%%% @doc The module offers an interface to the "ignore registry" -
%%% an in-memory storage used for avoiding redundant processing of
%%% blocks and transactions, in the setting of historically synchronous
%%% POST /block and POST /tx requests. An incoming block or transaction is
%%% temporary placed in the registry. Requests with the same identifiers
%%% are ignored for the time. After a block or a transaction is validated
%%% a permanent record can be inserted into the registry.
